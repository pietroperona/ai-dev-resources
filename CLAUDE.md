# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a curated documentation repository for AI developers containing external resources and references. It serves as an archive of useful documentation for navigating the AI and machine learning landscape.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into 6 main categories, each containing dedicated README files in both English and Italian:

- **fundamentals/**: Core AI and LLM concepts, focusing on Hands-On Large Language Models
- **agents/**: AI agent development resources with 45+ implementations using LangChain, LangGraph, PydanticAI
- **prompt-engineering/**: Complete guides for prompt optimization and techniques
- **production/**: Production deployment strategies for AI agents and systems
- **tutorials/**: Learning resources including 90+ free courses and interview preparation
- **tools/**: Curated tools and utilities for AI development

## Multilingual Support

The repository maintains content in multiple languages:
- **Primary language**: English (README.md files)
- **Secondary language**: Italian (README_IT.md files)
- **Root README**: Available in both languages with language selector

Each category folder contains:
- `README.md` - English version
- `README_IT.md` - Italian version

## Content Management

### Adding New Resources
When adding new resources:
1. Determine the appropriate category based on the resource type
2. Update both language versions of the relevant category README with detailed information including:
   - Repository link and description
   - Main content areas
   - Why it's useful for developers
   - Specific technologies or frameworks covered

### Documentation Style
- Primary documentation is in English, with Italian translations provided
- Each category README follows the same structure: description, main contents, and value proposition
- Include external repository links with proper attribution
- Focus on practical value and specific use cases
- Maintain consistency between language versions

### Repository Maintenance
- This is a documentation-only repository with no build processes, tests, or deployments
- Primary maintenance involves updating links, adding new resources, and improving documentation
- No code compilation or testing required - content is purely informational

## Content Philosophy

This repository curates external resources rather than hosting original code. The focus is on organizing and presenting valuable AI development resources in a structured, accessible way for the international developer community, with particular attention to English and Italian-speaking developers.
